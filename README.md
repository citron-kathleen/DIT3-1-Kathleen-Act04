1. How did you implement event handling for user actions?
- I used setOnClickListener for event handling to validate the age and name of the user, and lastly, the TextView entered by the user.

2. What techniques ensured smooth and stable interaction?
- One of the difficulties was keeping the data stored consistently after the changes in the database and assuring that, after returning to the main screen, the list displayed refreshed.

3. What improvements would you add in future versions?
- I would improve the UI responsiveness and enhance error handling to make the app more stable and user-friendly.
